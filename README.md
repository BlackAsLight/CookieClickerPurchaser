# CookieClickerPurchaser
This script runs on [this Cookie Clicker page](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).
This script is a simply script in that it will auto start new research for you, click on the a floating cookie if it appears, buy upgrades, and buy new products from the store when possible. After you get the first 15 cookies for the bot, you can literally do nothing and it will, very slowly at first, play the game for you.

When deciding what to buy next, it will calculate which one offers the best ROI. If it can't afford that one then it will check if there is an upgrade that it can afford. If it can't afford to purchase an upgrade or the best product within ~20s, it then settles for the best product that is currently affordable.

It is recommended to turn off short numbers under Options, otherwise it will only be able to handle numbers up to e+30

You might be asking yourself now, why does this even exist for a game that is pointless in itself. Well, why not? Computers should have fun too!
